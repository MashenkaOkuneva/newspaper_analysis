# Nowcasting German GDP with text data

## Overview

This repository contains the necessary resources to replicate the main results from the paper "Nowcasting German GDP with Text Data" by Mariia Okuneva, Philipp Hauber, Kai Carstensen, and Jasper BÃ¤r. It includes the code for sentiment extraction, topic modeling, and out-of-sample forecasting exercise.

  - **[Descriptive Statistics.ipynb](https://github.com/MashenkaOkuneva/newspaper_analysis/blob/main/data/Descriptive%20Statistics.ipynb)**: Calculates descriptive statistics for the full pre-processed dataset (all news media) and generates a figure showing daily publications across all media sources.
  - **[Descriptive Statistics (no pre-processing).ipynb](https://github.com/MashenkaOkuneva/newspaper_analysis/blob/main/data/Descriptive%20Statistics%20(no%20pre-processing).ipynb)**: Performs similar calculations and generates figures for the unprocessed version of the full dataset.
